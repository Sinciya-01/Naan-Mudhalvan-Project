How it Works:

  3.The API returns current weather data in JSON format.
  4.The JavaScript code extracts useful details such as temperature,humidity,wind speed and description.
  5.The dashboard displays the information instantly on the screen.
  6.The background or icon updates according to the weather condition(like sunnny,rainy or cloud).
